    So what is internet? the internet is like a wire , two computers connected
    directly or indirectly to this wire can communicate with each other.
    you must have heard the word 'server', a server is a computer connected directly to the internet
    , it displays webpages and files that are stored in it's hard drive.your computer is not a server it is
    a client , because it is not connected directly to the internet.so now the question is how are you able to 
    use the internet? your internet service provider connects your computer to the internet. 
    first you send your request to the internet service provider,it connects to the internet then goes to the related server
    get's the result and comes back.everything connected directly or indiretly to the internet 
     has a unique protocol adress (or IP address),IP address is like a postal code
    for the computers, it helps computers to find each other.but since humans can not remember
    Ip addresses they use domain name instead.like (google.com).</p>
    
</div>

<div class="continue-text">
    <p>but computers need to communicate through
     IP addresses not human selected domain names.(if you and your friends have a secret code for refering
     to a place,you can not expect the postman to understand your code.)
     that is where we need DNS ,DNS stands for domain name system and it is responsible for translating domain names
     into IP addresses.whenever you send something ,an image for example,computers break the information into
     smaller pieces called 'packets'.when info reaches it's destination the packets are reassembled in their original order.
     but how does the internet understand to send a data to a specefic root? if you are searching for a new job
     and your boss is doing market research using the same internet provider at the office what keeps your results
     from getting mixed ? anywhere two or more parts of the internet interact there is a piece of equipment called router,
     router directs your pocket around the internet.any time you visit a website upward of 10-15 routers may help your
     pockets to find their way to and from your computer.imagine each pocket as a piece of candy.It is wrapped in your computer
     IP address.first router adds it's own candy wrapper to this candy, each time a pocket reaches a new router another layer
     is added until it reaches the server.when the server sends back the info it creats pockets with identical wrapping.
     as it goes back to your computer,each router unpacks a layer to discover where to send the pocket next,until it
     reaches your computer.</p>
